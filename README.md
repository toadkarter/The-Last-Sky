# The Last Sky

This repository contains work for the Toy Box Game Jam 2023. There is no theme, but the game must be made using an asset pack provided at the outset of the jam. 

My goal for this jam was to create an engaging, tough 2D platformer in the style of Super Meat Boy or Celeste, but at the same time add a backstory to ensure that players are invested in seeing the game through to the end.
